      <p>
        Not the loud kind of year people post about.<br>
        Not a fairytale kella good days.<br>
        Bas sene ha2i2iye.<br>
        And that’s why it matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        You met me in a season where I was trying to hold myself together quietly.<br>
        Studying, doubting, pushing, falling, getting up—<br>
        sometimes all in the same day.
      </p>

      <p>
        You didn’t fix my life.<br>
        You didn’t pretend things were easy.<br>
        You just showed up.
      </p>

      <p>
        W enta mawjud halae bl fatra li ana taabene mn eno kun strong.<br>
        When I am anxious about the future.<br>
        When concours feels heavier than it should,
      </p>

      <p>
        You believe in me on days I couldn’t borrow belief from myself.<br>
        You remind me—sometimes gently, sometimes stubbornly—<br>
        that I’m more than my bad days,<br>
        and more than my fears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you this year taught me something quiet but powerful:<br>
        that support doesn’t always look like big words or perfect timing.<br>
        Sometimes it’s just being there.<br>
        Listening.<br>
        Letting me unravel without making me feel small for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know I wasn’t always easy to love.<br>
        I know I was anxious, sensitive, scared of losing balance.<br>
        But you held space for all of that<br>
        and never made me feel like my struggles made me less worthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This year wasn’t about perfection.<br>
        It was about choosing each other while growing,<br>
        even when growth was uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        So thank you—for the patience,<br>
        for the reassurance,<br>
        for standing next to me when life felt heavier than love should.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this year taught me anything,<br>
        it’s that love doesn’t save us from hard times—<br>
        it walks with us through them.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I’m grateful that this year,<br>
        I didn’t walk alone.
      </p>
